#KUDA BANK VR WEB APP

This is a VR replica of the Kuda Bank web application.
It was inspired by a UI design I saw on twitter some weeks ago.

It is designed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

The First page is designed to take your name as the input which the app will take in and display on the main app page as the user.

It was designed with an accurate media responsiveness which makes it compatible on any devices.

Feel free to navigate through the app.
